## Put comments here that give an overall description of what your
## functions do
##The first function assigns the inverse of a matrix to an object value in the environment.
##The second function checks if the inverse of the matrix is already calculated and comutes it if it is not available.
## Write a short comment describing this function
## This function assigns the value and provides access to the value of a matrix.
makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
  inv = NULL
  set = function(y) {
    # use `<<-` to assign a value to an object in an environment 
    # different from the current environment. 
    x <<- y
    inv <<- NULL
  }
  get = function() x
  setinv = function(inverse) inv <<- inverse 
  getinv = function() inv
  list(set=set, get=get, setinv=setinv, getinv=getinv)
}


## Write a short comment describing this function
## This function returns the inverse of a matrix by first checking if the inverse is already computed.
cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
  inv = x$getinv()
  
  # if the inverse has already been calculated
  if (!is.null(inv)){
    # get it from the cache and skips the computation. 
    message("getting cached data")
    return(inv)
  }
  
  # otherwise, calculates the inverse 
  mat.data = x$get()
  inv = solve(mat.data, ...)
  
  # sets the value of the inverse in the cache via the setinv function.
  x$setinv(inv)
  
  return(inv)
